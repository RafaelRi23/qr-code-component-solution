## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Doing this challenge helped me to acquire more knowledge about flexbox. I'm becoming more familiar with it.

### Continued development

In my future projects I want to learn more about media queries, image sizes and CSS in general, I am struggling a bit with these.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/) - This helped me when i was in doubt about some properties. Exceptional documentation.
- [Flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this
